# Automated-Driving-Code-Examples

MathWorks' materials on how to design, simulate, and test advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving systems using MATLAB® and Automated Driving System Toolbox™. This series of code examples provides full reference applications for common ADAS applications:

    ## Visual Perception Using a Monocular Camera:
    Construct a monocular camera sensor simulation capable of lane boundaries and vehicle detections.
    
    
    ## Forward Collision Warning Using Sensor Fusion:
    Perform forward collision warning by fusing data from vision and radar sensors to track objects in front of the vehicle.
    
    
    ## Sensor Fusion Using Synthetic Radar and Vision Data:
    Generate a scenario, simulate sensor detections, and use sensor fusion to track simulated vehicles.
